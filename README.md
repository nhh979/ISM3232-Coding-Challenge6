# Coding Challenge 6

In this project, we create a bouncing ball in the HTML Canvas. This porject enhances the understanding of object-oriented programming by utilizing a JavaScript class to create the Ball object with various methods for drawing and updating the ball's positions. Additionally, we learn how to work with HTML elements, such as **canvas** ans its attributes, and how to draw on the canvas by using **2D Context**. Finally, we apply `setInterval` function to make the animation, making the ball move and bounce within the canvas area.
